In this project, I explored integrating basic HTML and Bootstrap functionality. This included:

- Utilizing containers and fluid containers for responsive layout.
- Creating a simple input form with required validation.
- Designing a custom button that only appears at certain screen sizes.
- Implementing a table with Bootstrapâ€™s custom features for enhanced functionality, along with additional styling to improve readability.
- Applying a dark theme to the page to experiment with different design elements.
